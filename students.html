                 Yatri Modi is a master's student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  She received her bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai in 2018.  Yatri's work prior to joining UIC includes research on automatic seizure detection using EEG signals (<a href="https://www.ijcaonline.org/archives/volume176/number7/telang-2017-ijca-915637.pdf" target="_blank">Telang et al., 2017</a>) and automatic detection of fake news articles (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8869504" target="_blank">Telang et al., 2019</a>).  At UIC, she has conducted an error analysis of current visual storytelling models (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-1805.pdf" target="_blank">Modi and Parde, 2019</a>) and is working on developing an improved model.  Yatri's research interests are primarily in natural language processing, with emphases on fake news detection, language and vision (visual storytelling), question answering systems, and summarization.

         <b>Note (Updated May 2019): I do not currently have any funded RA positions available for the 2019-2020 academic year.</b>  If you do not need funding, or if you already have funding from some other source (e.g., TA position, research fellowship, etc.), feel free to read onward!
         <h2>Graduate</h2>
         I'm thrilled that you’re interested in working with me!  Disclaimers first:
         <ol>
            <li>Although I advise both doctoral and master's students, I generally do <i>not</i> have funding available for M.S. students.</li>
            <li>I receive many emails from prospective students, and unfortunately am not able to respond to them all (if I did, I wouldn't have time to respond to my current students!).  I'm not on the admissions committee, so I have very little influence on admissions decisions&mdash;emailing me prior to being admitted to UIC won't have an impact on the success of your application.  Instead, for information regarding admissions at UIC, I’d recommend checking out the requirements listed here: <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/graduate-admissions/" target="_blank">https://www.cs.uic.edu/graduate-admissions/</a>.  You can also contact our CS admissions team at <a href="mailto:gradapps@cs.uic.edu">gradapps@cs.uic.edu</a> regarding specific questions not answered on the UIC CS website.</li>
         </ol>
         Once you've been admitted, feel free to introduce yourself by sending me an email with the subject, "Reaching out after reading your website!"  I'm always searching for creative, self-motivated students to join my research group, and would be happy to set up a meeting at that time.
         <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
         If you are interested in working with me on a volunteer basis or for course credit/a capstone project, feel free to reach out to me via email!  I enjoy working with undergrads and have worked with many on past or current research projects.  Note that I require a minimum time commitment of 10 hours per week for all undergraduate researchers.
         <h2>Visiting</h2>
         At this time I do not have any short-term positions available for non-UIC students.  If you are interested in working with me in a more permanent capacity sometime in the future, please apply to UIC directly and send me an email once you’ve been admitted so we can set up a time to chat!
