         I'm thrilled that you’re interested in working with me!  Disclaimers first:
         <ol>
            <li>Although I advise both doctoral and master's students, I generally do <i>not</i> have funding available for M.S. students.</li>
            <li>Emailing me prior to being admitted to UIC is unlikely to have an impact on the success of your application.</li>
         </ol>
         If you're still here, feel free to introduce yourself by sending me an email with the subject, "Reaching out after reading your website!"  I'm always searching for creative, self-motivated students to join my research group, and would be happy to set up a meeting once you are admitted to the program.  For information regarding admissions at UIC, I’d recommend checking out the requirements listed here: <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/graduate-admissions/" target="_blank">https://www.cs.uic.edu/graduate-admissions/</a>.  You can also contact our CS admissions team at <a href="mailto:gradapps@cs.uic.edu">gradapps@cs.uic.edu</a> regarding specific questions not answered on the UIC CS website.
         <h2>Undergraduate</h2>
         <h2>Visiting</h2>
         At this time I do not have any short-term positions available for non-UIC students.  If you are interested in working with me in a more permanent capacity sometime in the future, please apply to UIC directly and send me an email once you’ve been admitted so we can set up a time to chat!
