        <h3>What is this class about?</h3>
        Natural language processing (NLP) is the subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on automatically understanding and generating natural language (e.g., languages that we use for day-to-day communication, such as English, Arabic, or Navajo).  It is pervasive in modern technology; popular examples include online search and chatbot applications.  This class will provide an introduction to the foundations and most popular tasks performed using natural language processing, through a combination of readings, lectures, short assignments, and projects.  Topics covered will include text preprocessing, part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, language representations, text classification, and dialogue systems, among others.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Textbooks</h3>
        Readings, learning content, and (some) assignments for this class will be drawn from the following source:
        <br />- <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/" target="_blank">Daniel Jurafsky and James H Martin. <i>Speech and Language Processing (3rd Edition)</i>. Draft, 2024.</a>
        <br /><br />
        This textbook is still being written; its current draft can be freely accessed at the link above.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        This is a 400-level course, designed for both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  Depending on your classification, you may have enrolled in either the four-hour version (grad students) or the three-hour version (undergrad students).  There are slightly different requirements for the two versions of the course, with the biggest difference being that students in the four-hour version will be required to complete a semester-long research study.  Undergrads may opt to complete this component as well if they would like, in which case their final course grade will be determined according to the same breakdown as that used for graduate students; however, doing this extra work is certainly not a requirement.  Some further details about the work you will be expected to complete for this course are provided below:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Python Bootcamp (Assignment 0):</b> One introductory coding "bootcamp" assignment will be due before submitting the first standard deliverable, to ensure necessary Python proficiency.</li>
            <li><b>Assignments:</b> Four assignments will be due over the course of the semester (due dates are indicated on the course calendar).  These assignments will contain a mix of theoretical and coding questions.  Code should be written in Python.</li>
            <li><b>Project:</b> All students will complete a semester-long project, divided into three deliverables (due dates are indicated on the course calendar).  Code, when applicable, should be written in Python.</li>
            <li><b>Research Study:</b> Graduate students (and any undergraduates who choose to do so) will complete a semester-long study pertaining to research reproducibility and evaluation, due the week before finals week.  For the study, students will analyze the reproducibility of an existing NLP research paper.  These studies can be completed individually or in pairs; if done in pairs, the submission must be accompanied by a statement detailing which component(s) each student worked on, signed by both students.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Grading rubrics will be posted in the deliverables' descriptions.  Final course grades will be determined according to the following breakdowns:
        <ul>
            <li>Undergraduate Students:
            <ul>
                <li>Python Bootcamp (Assignment 0): 5%</li>
                <li>Project: 39% (13% for each deliverable)</li>
                <li>Assignments: 56% (14% for each assignment)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Graduate Students:
            <ul>
                <li>Python Bootcamp (Assignment 0): 4%</li>
                <li>Project: 30% (10% for each deliverable)</li>
                <li>Assignments: 48% (12% for each assignment)</li>
                <li>Research Study: 18% (4% for the presentation, 10% for the report, and 4% for the source code)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
