            <h3>What is this class about?</h3>
            Researchers in artificial intelligence are increasingly applying multimodal solutions to traditional problems, especially within the realm of natural language processing.  In particular, synthesizing NLP with computer vision allows intelligent systems to harness both visual and linguistic information to generate content and derive meaning.  This seminar course will introduce you to current research in fundamental language + vision problems, and provide you with a scientific background in relevant application areas.  By the end of the course, you will have gained exposure to core concepts through a combination of: lectures on fundamental principles of NLP, CV, and deep learning; paper discussions; and a semester-long project in a focus area that you select.  Topics covered will include grounded language learning, physically situated dialogue, automated image captioning, automated video description, visual question answering, text-to-image generation, visual story entailment, and language disambiguation via images.
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Textbooks and Readings</h3>
            Recommended reading for the first three weeks (lectures on fundamental principles of NLP, CV, and deep learning) will be from the following sources:
            <br />- <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/" target="_blank">Dan Jurafsky and James H Martin. <i>Speech and language processing</i>, volume 3. Pearson London, 2014</a>
            <br />- <a href="http://szeliski.org/Book/" target="_blank">Richard Szeliski. <i>Computer vision: algorithms and applications</i>. Springer Science & Business Media, 2010</a>
            <br />- <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14539" target="_blank">Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton. Deep learning. <i>Nature</i>, 521(7553):436, 2015</a>
            <br /><br />
            Free versions of these resources can be accessed at the links above.  Reading materials for the remainder of the course will be comprised of conference and journal papers, all accessible online.  A list of suggested discussion papers is provided on Blackboard.  You're also welcome to suggest discussion papers that are not on this list (all suggested papers are subject to my approval).  I'll post the list of papers that will be discussed each week once the paper selections have been finalized.
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Assignments</h3>
            This is a seminar-style class.  Instead of having traditional homework and exams, we'll have presentations and projects!  Specifically, your course work will be comprised of the following:
            <ul>
            <li><b>Paper reviews:</b> Each "paper discussion" week, you will be required to submit a short (~ one page double-spaced) critique of one of the papers being discussed.  The critique should include a brief summary of the paper, highlights of aspects of the paper that are particularly good or should be improved, an analysis of the soundness of the methodology and evaluation, and an explanation of whether or not the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified.  I've written an example paper critique and posted it on Blackboard to provide some guidance as to what a good paper critique might look like.</li>
            <li><b>Paper Presentations:</b> Each paper discussion will be led by three students: one will provide an overview of the paper, one will argue in favor of the paper, and one will (diplomatically!) argue against the paper.  You will be required to fill each role once.  I've posted an example presentation on Blackboard to provide some guidance as to what each of these components might look like.</li>
            <li><b>Project Presentations:</b> You will be required to give three short presentations about your semester-long project: a proposal at the beginning of the semester, a mid-semester project update, and an end-of-semester final presentation.  The first two presentations will each be five minutes with an additional minute for questions, and the final presentation will be ten minutes with two additional minutes for questions.</li>
            <li><b>Project Write-Up:</b> You will be required to write a conference/journal-style paper about your project, including a literature review, methodology, evaluation, and conclusions.  The formatting can vary, depending on which venue you're writing it for ...you can view this as an easy way to have a paper ready to submit by the end of the semester, complete with feedback from a faculty member!</li>
            <li><b>Project:</b> A central component of this course is the semester-long project.  You'll complete your projects independently (if you and one or more of your classmates are working collaboratively on ongoing research, please clearly define separate sub-projects), and your projects must be relevant to the central theme of the course (language and vision) ...I'd encourage you to run your proposed topic by me before your project proposal, just to make sure you're on the right track.  That being said, you'll be afforded considerable flexibility in selecting your project topics.  Ideally, if you're working on a thesis or dissertation, you'll be able to incorporate the work resulting from this course into your research.</li>
            </ul>
            
            I've posted my grading rubrics for each of these assignments on Blackboard, in the interest of transparency.  Your final course grade will be determined according to the following breakdown:
            <ul>
            <li>Paper Critiques: 24% (3% per paper critique)</li>
            <li>Paper Presentations: 26% (10% overview, 8% pros, and 8% cons)</li>
            <li>Project Presentations: 20% (5% proposal, 5% update, and 10% final presentation)</li>
            <li>Project Write-Up: 15%</li>
            <li>Project: 15%</li>
            </ul>
