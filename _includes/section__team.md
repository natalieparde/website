## Prospective Team Members  {#prospective-students}

**I will be recruiting a new PhD student to start in 2024.**  If you're interested in working with my group on a topic pertaining to creative language, multimodal NLP, or healthcare applications, please list me as a potential advisor in your research statement when applying to UIC!  This will make it easy for admissions to flag your application for me (and other NLP faculty) to review.  Due to email volume and to protect my current bandwidth for existing students, I am unable to review application materials prior to this, and I cannot respond to emails with those materials.  I'd recommend checking out the requirements [here](https://cs.uic.edu/graduate/admissions/), or emailing our excellent CS staff at [cs-grad@uic.edu](mailto:cs-grad@uic.edu) for more information about how to join UIC's Department of Computer Science.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**What do I look for in applications from prospective PhD students?**  I'm often asked what I'm looking for in applications from prospective PhD students, and I'm happy to provide additional transparency regarding this!  Things that I tend to prioritize most in applications are:
- **Research Fit.** I'm especially looking for team members with interests that align with my own research agenda, or that fill existing gaps in my research group.  My favorite research topics are creative language (for example, processing and understanding metaphor), multimodality (for example, grounded dialogue with robots), and healthcare applications (for example, recognizing cognitive decline from spoken language).
- **Writing Skills.** I like to collaborate with strong writers, as evidenced by GRE verbal and analytical writing scores or other writing samples (including your statement of purpose!).
- **Creativity and Independence.** I like working with people who prefer proposing and pursuing their own ideas.  To that end, I like research meetings to feel collaborative (where we discuss your ideas and I provide high-level feedback) rather than hierarchical (where I tell you what to do).

&nbsp;&nbsp;

On a philosophical level, I tend to view natural language processing as a way to better understand language and various facets of society.  I tend to avoid working on problems that are primarily focused on machine learning fundamentals, and I like to work with researchers who genuinely enjoy language and linguistics.  I'm happy to work with people who do not have formal training in computer science, but note that I (and my students) are housed in UIC's Department of Computer Science. If your undergraduate degree was not in CS, you will be required by the department to take certain undergraduate CS classes upon admission and prior to beginning full graduate-level coursework.

### Graduate

If you're a current or admitted UIC graduate student, or if you have already submitted your application to UIC's PhD program, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6](https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6).  I review responses regularly, and will contact you for more information if I have a role that matches your interests.  I'm always looking for creative, self-motivated researchers to join my team, but availability of certain positions may be restricted depending on lab capacity or funding needs.

&nbsp; 

**I do not currently have any open, funded positions for Summer or Fall 2023.**  If/when additional funded positions become available, I will post the application here.

&nbsp;  

### Undergraduate

If you are interested in working with me on a volunteer basis, for course credit, or for a capstone project, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118](https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118).  I enjoy working with undergrads and have worked with many on past or current research projects.  Note that I require a minimum time commitment of 10 hours per week for all undergraduate researchers, and availability of these positions may be restricted depending on lab capacity to protect bandwidth for existing advisees.

&nbsp;  

### Visiting

At this time I do not have any short-term positions available for non-UIC students.  If you are interested in working with me in a more permanent capacity sometime in the future, please apply to UIC directly and fill out the relevant form listed above once you've submitted your application to ensure that you are considered for available positions once you are admitted.
