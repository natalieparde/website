## Prospective Team Members  {#prospective-students}

**Note (Updated June 2021): All funded RA positions for the 2021-2022 academic year have now been filled.**  If you do not need funding, or if you already have funding from some other source, feel free to read onward!  If you do need funding, make sure to check back regularly.  If/when additional funded positions become available, I will post the application here.

&nbsp;  

### Graduate

I'm thrilled that you're interested in working with me!  I receive many emails everyday and prioritize responses to my existing advisees, so unfortunately am not able to respond to external meeting requests or questions regarding UIC graduate admissions.  I'd recommend checking out the requirements [here](https://cs.uic.edu/graduate/admissions/), or emailing our excellent CS staff at [cs-grad@uic.edu](mailto:cs-grad@uic.edu) for more information about how to join UIC's Department of Computer Science.  

&nbsp;  

If you're a current or admitted UIC graduate student, or if you have already submitted your application to UIC's PhD program, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6](https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6).  I review responses regularly, and will contact you for more information if I have a role that matches your interests.  I'm always looking for creative, self-motivated researchers to join my team, but availability of certain positions may be restricted depending on lab capacity or funding needs.

### Undergraduate

If you are interested in working with me on a volunteer basis, for course credit, or for a capstone project, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118](https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118).  I enjoy working with undergrads and have worked with many on past or current research projects.  Note that I require a minimum time commitment of 10 hours per week for all undergraduate researchers.

&nbsp;  

### Visiting

At this time I do not have any short-term positions available for non-UIC students.  If you are interested in working with me in a more permanent capacity sometime in the future, please apply to UIC directly and fill out the relevant form listed above once you've submitted your application to ensure that you are considered for available positions once you are admitted.
