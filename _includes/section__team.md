## Prospective Team Members  {#prospective-students}

**I will be recruiting one new PhD student to start in Fall 2023.**  If you're interested in working with my group on a topic pertaining to creative language, multimodal NLP, or healthcare applications, please list me as a potential advisor in your research statement when applying to UIC!  This will make it easy for admissions to flag your application for me.  If you have specific questions about how your preferred research topic might fit in with ongoing projects or are otherwise curious about UIC's NLP group, feel free to send me an email (I receive many, many emails every day so please do not feel bad if I miss yours, and feel free to resend).  Unfortunately, due to email volume and to protect my current bandwidth for existing students, I am unable to review application materials prior to receiving them directly from our admissions committee, and cannot respond to emails with those materials.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**I do not currently have any open, funded positions for the 2022/2023 academic year.**  If you do not need funding, or if you already have funding from some other source, feel free to read onward!  If you do need funding, make sure to check back regularly.  If/when additional funded positions become available, I will post the application here.

### Graduate

I'm thrilled that you're interested in working with me!  I receive many emails everyday and prioritize responses to my existing advisees, so unfortunately am not able to respond to external meeting requests or questions regarding UIC graduate admissions.  I'd recommend checking out the requirements [here](https://cs.uic.edu/graduate/admissions/), or emailing our excellent CS staff at [cs-grad@uic.edu](mailto:cs-grad@uic.edu) for more information about how to join UIC's Department of Computer Science.  

&nbsp;  

If you're a current or admitted UIC graduate student, or if you have already submitted your application to UIC's PhD program, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6](https://forms.gle/NtFCvHXvi8gH7Y2h6).  I review responses regularly, and will contact you for more information if I have a role that matches your interests.  I'm always looking for creative, self-motivated researchers to join my team, but availability of certain positions may be restricted depending on lab capacity or funding needs.

&nbsp;  

### Undergraduate

If you are interested in working with me on a volunteer basis, for course credit, or for a capstone project, feel free to fill out the following form: [https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118](https://forms.gle/tUQDQtYbhL8t9g118).  I enjoy working with undergrads and have worked with many on past or current research projects.  Note that I require a minimum time commitment of 10 hours per week for all undergraduate researchers, and availability of these positions may be restricted depending on lab capacity to protect bandwidth for existing advisees.

&nbsp;  

### Visiting

At this time I do not have any short-term positions available for non-UIC students.  If you are interested in working with me in a more permanent capacity sometime in the future, please apply to UIC directly and fill out the relevant form listed above once you've submitted your application to ensure that you are considered for available positions once you are admitted.
