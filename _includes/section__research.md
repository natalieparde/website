### Healthcare Applications {#healthcare}

My work at the intersection of natural language processing and healthcare focuses primarily on aspects of cognition, health behavior, and caregiver support.  My current and past collaborators in this area include researchers from UIC, UI Health, the University of California, San Diego, and the University of North Texas.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

In my group's work towards **cognitive assessment**, we develop automated language-based approaches for course- and fine-grained dementia detection, predicting both diagnostic status and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores based on speech and language patterns in transcribed speech samples.  Some of our recent publications in this area include:
* Shahla Farzana and Natalie Parde. [Are Interaction Patterns Helpful for Task-Agnostic Dementia Detection? An Empirical Exploration.](www.natalieparde.com/files/sigdial2022_farzana_parde.pdf) In the *Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2022)*.

In my group's project collaborating with researchers in UIC's [CPERL](https://cperl.ahs.uic.edu/) group, we are investigating ways to **support caregivers** of children with pediatric rehabilitation needs through the development of smart and connected tools for equitable early intervention service design.  This project is funded by the National Science Foundation and involves the development of novel techniques for dialogue systems and caregiver strategy classification.

In my group's work pertaining to **medical self-disclosure** in online communities, we created a dataset of health-related forum posts, annotated for self-disclosure status, and established a performance benchmark for automatically detecting medical self-disclosure.  More information about this project, including details for accessing the dataset, can be found here:

In my earlier work towards providing **cognitive support**, I developed a human-robot book discussion system, implemented using NAO robots.  The robots generated questions about novel metaphors automatically identified in fiction literature, which they used as the basis for conversation.  Some publications regarding this project include:

### Multimodality {#multimodality}

My work in multimodal natural language processing has primarily centered on language and vision.  My group investigates numerous topics falling under this umbrella, recently including visual storytelling and the detection of misogynistic memes.  Papers addressing these topics can be found here:
* Charic Farinango Cuervo and Natalie Parde. [UIC-NLP at SemEval-2022 Task 5: Exploring Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Detection of Misogynistic Memes.](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.109.pdf) In the *Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2022)*.

</p>

In my earlier work, I focused on grounded language learning, which seeks to model language leveraging non-linguistic experience in additional to more traditionally-examined word co-occurrence.  I implemented a human-robot guessing game using NAO robots that facilitated language learning through interactive gameplay.  Some publications regarding this project include:
* Natalie Parde, Adam Hair, Michalis Papakostas, Konstantinos Tsiakas, Maria Dagioglou, Vangelis Karkaletsis, and Rodney D. Nielsen. [Grounding the Meaning of Words through Vision and Interactive Gameplay](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/269.pdf).

### Creative Language {#creative-language}

My work on creative language has primarily focused on metaphor and sarcasm processing.  In the context of metaphor processing, I have specifically examined automated detection of metaphor novelty---that is, the distinction between conventionalized and novel metaphor usage.  I created a large, publicly available dataset of syntactically-related word pairs labeled for metaphor novelty on a continuous scale, and performed a series of experiments to establish proof-of-concept for the task as well as a performance benchmark.  Some publications regarding this work include the following:
* Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. [A Corpus of Metaphor Novelty Scores for Syntactically-Related Word Pairs](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/242.pdf). In the *Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018)*. Miyazaki, Japan, May 7-12, 2018.
* Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. [Exploring the Terrain of Metaphor Novelty: A Regression-based Approach for Automatically Scoring Metaphors](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11940). In the *Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2018)*. New Orleans, Louisiana, February 2-7, 2018. 
* Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. [Finding Patterns in Noisy Crowds: Regression-based Annotation Aggregation for Crowdsourced Data](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1204). In the *Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017)*. Copenhagen, Denmark, September 7-11, 2017.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

In my work on sarcasm detection, I developed a domain-general approach that distinguished between sarcasm and other forms of emotional communication in Twitter and Amazon product reviews.  Some papers describing this work include:
* Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. [Detecting Sarcasm is Extremely Easy ;-)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-1303.pdf). In the *Proceedings of the NAACL 2018 Workshop on Computational Semantics Beyond Events and Roles (SemBEaR 2018)*. New Orleans, Louisiana, June 5, 2018. 
* Natalie Parde and Rodney D. Nielsen. [#SarcasmDetection is soooo general! Towards a Domain-Independent Approach for Detecting Sarcasm](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS17/paper/download/15421/14939). In *Proceedings of the 30th International FLAIRS Conference (FLAIRS 2017)*. Marco Island, Florida, May 22-24, 2017.

### Other Prior Research

In addition to my main areas of interest, I have previously collaborated with cybersecurity and cognitive science researchers on several projects.  My research group has conducted a small amount of work on video generation, finance, and reproducibility, and as an undergraduate I was part of the team developing [UNTANGLED](https://untangled3.unt.edu/home.php), an award-winning online game that sought to harness human intuition to solve real-world hardware mapping problems by abstracting them as puzzles.  More details about all of these projects can be found on my publications page.
