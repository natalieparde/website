### Healthcare Applications {#healthcare}

My work at the intersection of natural language processing and healthcare focuses primarily on aspects of cognitive and mental health, caregiver support, and online behavior.  My current collaborators in this area include researchers from UIC, UI Health, and the University of California, San Diego.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

In my group's work related to **cognitive and mental health**, we have developed approaches for spoken language detection of cognitive and mental health conditions.  In the area of cognitive health, we've worked on Alzheimer's disease detection and prediction of fine-grained cognitive health scores; more recently, we've also developed a dataset to facilitate pioneering studies of language patterns in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.  In the area of mental health, we've worked on recognizing language characteristics in individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia when participating in a spoken dialogue social skills performance assessment.  Portions of this work were funded by the National Institutes of Health.  Some of our recent publications in this area include:
* Shahla Farzana,* Edoardo Stoppa,* Alex Leow, Tamar Gollan, Raeanne Moore, David Salmon, Douglas Galasko, Erin Sundermann, and Natalie Parde. [SLaCAD: A Spoken Language Corpus for Early Alzheimer's Disease Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.1296.pdf).

In my group's project collaborating with researchers in UIC's [CPERL](https://cperl.ahs.uic.edu/) group, we are investigating ways to **support caregivers** of children with pediatric rehabilitation needs through the development of smart and connected tools for equitable early intervention service design.  This project is funded by the National Science Foundation and involves the development of novel techniques for dialogue systems and caregiver strategy classification.  Some papers describing more about aspects of the project background include:
* Mina Valizadeh,* Vera Kaelin, Mary Khetani, and Natalie Parde. [CareCorpus: A Corpus of Real-World Solution-Focused Caregiver Strategies for Personalized Pediatric Rehabilitation Service Design](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.256.pdf).

November 2021.

In my group's work pertaining to **health-related online behavior** we have examined medical self-disclosure and (more recently) empathy in online health forums.  This has resulted in two innovative datasets: one pertaining to medical self-disclosure, and AcnEmpathize, a novel dataset of domain-specific health-related online empathy.  More information about this work, including details for accessing these datasets, can be found here:

### Multimodality {#multimodality}

My work in multimodal natural language processing has primarily centered on language and vision.  My group investigates numerous topics falling under this umbrella, recently including visual storytelling and the detection of misogynistic memes.  Papers addressing these topics can be found here:
* Charic Farinango Cuervo and Natalie Parde. [UIC-NLP at SemEval-2022 Task 5: Exploring Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Detection of Misogynistic Memes.](https://aclanthology.org/2022.semeval-1.109.pdf) In the *Proceedings of the 16th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2022)*.

### Creative Language {#creative-language}

My work on creative language has primarily focused on figurative language.  Recently, my group has examined metaphor, idiom, and hyperbole in empathetic online communication (publication forthcoming).  We also conducted a focused study on euphemism.  Some publications regarding this, along with my earlier work on metaphor novelty and sarcasm in more generalized domains, include the following:
* Devika Tiwari* and Natalie Parde. [An Exploration of Linguistically-Driven and Transfer Learning Methods for Euphemism Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2022.flp-1.18/).
