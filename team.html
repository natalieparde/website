                <p>Eli Whitehouse is a doctoral student in the computer science department at the University of Illinois Chicago.  He holds undergraduate degrees in mathematics and computer science from Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University in the City of New York.  Eli's research is focused on how we can use natural language processing systems to create more expressive, personal, and personalizable interfaces for the many programs that mediate and structure digital interactions between human beings online, today.  Eli seeks to utilize methods from reliability-oriented disciplines, such as software verification and formal methods, to better structure and support the interactions of language models.</p>
